# Widget authoring references

Use this index to choose a reference for building or editing widgets in paired Composer. Widget-specific authoring guides live in `widgets/`; this index stays at `references/widgets.md`. Read only the document matching the task, alongside [graphics.md](graphics.md) for shared layout, color, and declarative-specification rules.

Selection follows the creation-default policy in the runtime skill: use the matching Metric Text family primitive for newly authored text. Legacy `text` and `text-ticker` remain supported for inspection, editing, and additions that preserve an existing composition's legacy typography. Do not introduce Bodymovin, Sound, Video, or Web Page content unless the request or supplied material identifies that external runtime dependency. Image, HTML, AISVG, tickers, clocks, timers, Table, and Grid are conditional on their actual semantic need rather than default decoration. Existing specialized widgets may still be inspected, preserved, or edited when the user targets them.

| `bodymovin` | [Bodymovin](widgets/bodymovin.md) | Lottie JSON URL assets and Composer-driven widget Timeline animation. |
| `bodymovin-loop` | [Bodymovin Loop](widgets/bodymovin-loop.md) | Continuously looping Lottie assets, speed, direction, and timed capture. |
| `sound` | [Sound](widgets/sound.md) | Audio URL, volume, In/Out/loop playback policy, and Player-only verification. |
| `video-animation` | [Video Animation](widgets/video-animation.md) | Separate In, Out, and optional loop clips, fit, shift, and crossfade timing. |
| `video-background` | [Video Background](widgets/video-background.md) | Muted looping background video, fit, shift, and composition-state playback. |
| `video-clip` | [Video Clip](widgets/video-clip.md) | Muted controllable clip playback, looping, fit, opacity, and button actions. |
| `video-clip-with-audio` | [Video Clip with Audio](widgets/video-clip-with-audio.md) | Audible controllable clip playback with the Video Clip field and button contract. |
| `web-page` | [Web Page](widgets/web-page.md) | Embedded HTTP(S) page URL and optional periodic iframe reload. |
| `timer` | [Timer](widgets/timer.md) | Time Control input, count-up/count-down bounds, formatting, frequency, and Widget Node templates. |
| `date-time-countdown` | [Date / Time Countdown](widgets/date-time-countdown.md) | Absolute target dates, stop/continue behavior, padding, and widget-owned digit templates. |
| `current-date-time` | [Current Date and Time](widgets/current-date-time.md) | Formatted clocks, fixed UTC offsets, locale, update frequency, and Widget Node templates. |

The index routes to knowledge; it does not duplicate schemas. Run `primitives --primitive <name>` to discover the loaded field contract and `get` for an existing instance. The live schema determines accepted fields and value shapes; authoring references explain how to use them. For widget-owned templates, also read [widget-subcompositions.md](widget-subcompositions.md) and [Widget Nodes](widget-nodes.md) when the owner supplies template outputs.

## Scripting is a separate phase

For JavaScript payload changes or runtime behavior, follow [composition-scripts.md](composition-scripts.md), then use its handoff routes and [widget scripting reference index](composition-scripting/widget-references.md). The `composition-scripting/widget-*.md` documents own runtime payload contracts. They do not replace the authoring references above or authorize scripts through the paired editor relay.
