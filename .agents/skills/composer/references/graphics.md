# Graphics: primitives, layout, and declarative specifications

## Primitives

Video and embedded-page primitives additionally include `video-animation`, `video-background`, `video-clip`, `video-clip-with-audio`, and `web-page`; use their dedicated authoring guides from [widgets.md](widgets.md).

Use [widgets.md](widgets.md) to find the matching widget authoring reference. This document owns shared schema discovery, color, layout, and declarative-specification rules; widget-specific behavior and examples belong in the linked guides. Runtime payload updates belong to the separate composition-script workflow.

List the supported primitives and their control-field schemas before creating graphics:

```bash
node scripts/composer-agent.js primitives
```

The `primitives` response is the authoritative supported-name inventory for the loaded editor. Use [widgets.md](widgets.md) to choose the matching authoring guide. Prefer [Metric Text](widgets/metric-text.md) for single-line text, [Metric Text ML](widgets/metric-text-ml.md) for multiline text, [Metric Text Animation](widgets/metric-text-animation.md) for native character/word effects, [Metric Text Style](widgets/metric-text-style.md) for styled SVG text, and [Metric Text Ticker](widgets/metric-text-ticker.md) for Font 2.0 crawls. Use [Text Ticker](widgets/text-ticker.md) only for legacy-font crawls or consistency with an existing legacy composition. AISVG remains the bounded escape hatch for vector geometry or motion that standard primitives cannot express. When you know the primitive, filter to it so the schema stays small:

```bash
node scripts/composer-agent.js primitives --primitive metric-text
```

Never assume a control value shape. Read each field's schema and `runtime` object from `primitives`; for non-color fields, the runtime value reports the exact type and a complete accepted value. For an existing tile, `get` returns current `data` plus the same schema populated from current values.

Datetime fields are schema-aware: an unset empty string may become an integer Unix millisecond timestamp within the JavaScript Date range, and an empty string may unset it again. Other strings and fractional or out-of-range numbers are rejected. This applies to direct data updates and declarative properties; Date Time Control Nodes require a configured numeric timestamp. See [Date / Time Countdown](widgets/date-time-countdown.md) for its widget-owned template and ticking behavior.

The [Gradient widget](widgets/gradient.md) uses a `css_string` textarea containing CSS declarations. It is distinct from schema fields typed `gradient` and from the unsupported native Gradient Control Node.

Color is another deliberate exception to runtime-shape preservation. For any widget field whose schema type is `color` or `gradient`, use an RGBA object as the primary solid-color format:

```json
{ "r": 0, "g": 74, "b": 173, "a": 1 }
```

RGBA is tinycolor2-compatible and Composer renders it directly as a color or converts it to a solid gradient as required by the widget. Do not copy a structured gradient from `get` or `primitives` merely because that is how Composer stores or reports the field. Use a complete structured gradient runtime object only when the user explicitly asks for a linear, radial, multi-stop, or otherwise non-solid gradient. Author that object directly on the compatible widget field; do not create a Gradient Control Node for it. Native Gradient controls are intentionally outside agent support because their complex payload is not a suitable external-control contract. Tinycolor2-compatible strings may be accepted by underlying widget paths, but RGBA remains the agent's default format.

Other shape-sensitive values still follow readback exactly: Text `font` is an object containing `fontData` and formatting, for example. Use the catalog-backed commands in [text.md](widgets/text.md) for font changes.

Table is an approved widget primitive rather than a flat shape. Creating it adds widget `1182` through Composer's normal widget path. Before adding rows, ensure its `composition` field points to a valid row-template composition, inspect that relationship with `widget-subcompositions`, and populate it with `update-table`; see [table.md](widgets/table.md). Do not guess a template ID or reuse one after leaving template edit mode.

Grid (`3284`) similarly repeats a hidden cell template, using `cols`/`rows`, spacing, pagination and validated `update-grid` content. See [Grid](widgets/grid.md). This widget is separate from the declarative `grids` layout definitions below, which place ordinary primitives at authoring time.

Bodymovin (`3367`) loads a hosted Lottie JSON URL and uses the Composer `widget` Timeline effect. For continuous playback with speed and direction controls, use `bodymovin-loop` (`3783`). See [Bodymovin](widgets/bodymovin.md) and [Bodymovin Loop](widgets/bodymovin-loop.md) for their separate asset, playback, and verification requirements.

For widget-supplied template output, build the target primitives first, then use a bounded [Widget Node link batch](widget-nodes.md). These links are separate from declarative public `control` declarations. Reapply stable-keyed graphics carefully: avoid explicitly resetting a field whose current value is driven by a Widget Node; inspect its native link first.

## Managed group and one-off primitives

`graphics.apply` is a reconciler: it deletes and reorders whatever it finds in the group it manages. That group, named `AI Generated`, is the boundary of the diff, not a permission boundary. Keep generated content in it so `apply` never reaches the rest of the scene.

`create` always places its unkeyed primitive in `AI Generated`. Use it only for one isolated edit or diagnosis inside an ordinary graphic sub-composition:

```bash
node scripts/composer-agent.js ensure-group
node scripts/composer-agent.js create --primitive metric-text --name "Team name"
node scripts/composer-agent.js delete --id <tile-id>
```

To release that primitive from reconciliation ownership, create or identify the intended ordinary group, then run `move --id <tile-id> --group-id <group-id>` after readback. Do not use this sequence to place new visual primitives directly in root. Primitives are created with no In or Out animation.

Prefer declarative `apply` over one-off `create` for anything beyond a single scratch element.

## Layout math

Composer layout values are percentages of the active resolution. The default anchor is `{ "x": 50, "y": 50 }`, and `left`/`top` are offsets from the anchor-derived position — **not** absolute canvas coordinates:

```text
renderedLeft = left + (100 - width)  * anchor.x / 100
renderedTop  = top  + (100 - height) * anchor.y / 100
```

To place a box with top-left `(x, y)`:

```text
left = x - (100 - width)  * anchor.x / 100
top  = y - (100 - height) * anchor.y / 100
```

Do not treat `left: 50` as "centered" with a 50/50 anchor; a centered box commonly has `left: 0`. Ignoring this is the most frequent cause of off-screen or clipped graphics.

Common layout fields are `left`, `top`, `width`, `height`, `scaleX`, `scaleY`, `rotateZ`, and `anchor`. The complete active Effect layout model is authorable for tiles and groups. Start with the compact effective toolkit—shadow, opacity, blur, and X/Y skew—before reaching for the broader filters:

```json
{
  "layout": {
    "opacity": 85,
    "filterBlur": 2,
    "skewX": -12,
    "skewY": 0,
    "filterDropShadowMode": "box",
    "filterDropShadowX": 0.01,
    "filterDropShadowY": 6,
    "filterDropShadowBlur": 16,
    "filterDropShadowSpread": 0,
    "filterDropShadowColor": { "r": 0, "g": 0, "b": 0, "a": 0.35 }
  }
}
```

The full typed set includes visibility; scale and scale lock; skew; box/drop shadow including color, spread, and inset; opacity, blur, brightness, contrast, grayscale, hue rotation, invert, saturation, and sepia filters; and backface visibility. The exact ranges and enums are listed in [commands.md](commands.md). Use these broader properties only when they materially serve the requested design—being available does not make them preferable to clearer widget properties, gradients, or layered primitives.

Native limitations remain authoritative: drop shadow ignores spread and inset; backface visibility only affects 3D mode; and an exact shadow X/Y of `0` falls back to 5 pixels. Use a very small non-zero X/Y for a visually centered shadow and report the approximation. Disabled Effect features such as blend mode and image masks, plus the separate composition Style selector, are not part of this layout contract.

## Declarative specification

Save the specification in the session artifacts directory, then validate and apply it:

```bash
node scripts/composer-agent.js validate --file <spec.json>
node scripts/composer-agent.js apply --file <spec.json>
```

`graphics.validate` never mutates and reports every error with an element key and property path. `apply` validates the whole specification, then applies it in one undo batch and rolls back on an unexpected runtime error.

```json
{
  "version": 2,
  "elements": [
    {
      "key": "score-background",
      "primitive": "rectangle",
      "name": "Score background",
      "layout": { "left": 5, "top": 5, "width": 35, "height": 12 },
      "properties": { "width": 100, "height": 100 }
    }
  ]
}
```

Rules:

- `version: 2` is required. Missing or unsupported versions fail with `UNSUPPORTED_GRAPHICS_VERSION` at `version`.
- `elements` is required and holds at most 100 entries.
- `key` is required, unique, and stable across refinement passes. Keys are 1-100 characters of letters, numbers, dots, underscores, and hyphens.
- `name` is optional and defaults to the key.
- `layout` accepts the constrained geometry fields plus the complete documented Effect-property set.
- `properties` keys must exist in the selected primitive schema, and values must match the current or default field type. Schema fields typed `color` or `gradient` are the exception: use an RGBA object for a solid color even when the current/default value is a structured gradient.
- The array order is **back-to-front**: backgrounds first, foreground text last.

### Managed group bounds and clipping

A version-2 specification may configure the bounds of its existing `AI Generated` ownership group. All declarative elements are children of that group, so clipping applies to their rendered and animated content without adding a second reconciliation boundary:

```json
{
  "version": 2,
  "group": {
    "layout": {
      "anchor": { "x": 0, "y": 0 },
      "left": 10,
      "top": 10,
      "width": 30,
      "height": 12,
      "groupClipChildren": true,
      "groupBorderRadiusMode": true,
      "groupBorderRadiusValueTL": 4
    }
  },
  "elements": []
}
```

The group definition is optional and idempotent. It accepts the same constrained fields as `configure-group`; image masks remain unavailable because Composer's mask renderer is disabled. `groupClipChildren` is the supported masking primitive and renders as bounded overflow clipping. The apply response includes the authoritative managed-group ID and layout so it can be targeted by group animation or inspected afterward.

Prefer group-owned geometry for a coherent visual unit. Give the group its canvas-level `left`, `top`, `width`, and `height`, then express children relative to that frame: backgrounds commonly use `left: 0`, `top: 0`, `width: 100`, and `height: 100`, while text and accents use local percentage insets. Avoid duplicating the unit's absolute canvas bounds across its widgets. This keeps moving and resizing the complete unit understandable in Composer while preserving independent child geometry where the design requires it.

Reconciliation:

- Reapplying a key with the same primitive updates the same tile and preserves matching Control Node links.
- Changing the primitive for an unlinked key replaces only that managed tile.
- Omitting an unlinked prior declarative key deletes that managed tile.
- Changing or omitting a **linked** keyed primitive is rejected as a conflict instead of silently removing links.
- Manually created managed primitives without declarative keys are preserved, behind the declarative scene.
- A keyed element that has left the managed group by any route is released: `apply` clears its key, reports it under `released`, and rebuilds the key as a new element.
- An empty `elements` array clears declarative graphics but preserves unkeyed managed and user-created content.

The apply response maps stable keys to current Composer tile IDs, reports `created`, `updated`, `unchanged`, or `replaced`, and lists deleted keyed elements.

Before reapplying, inspect the managed scope and reconcile deliberate changes made after the previous apply. Treat the new response as authoritative: omitted keys are deleted, while `replaced` keys receive new tile IDs that invalidate ID-based references and motion assignments. Read the new tile, rebuild the required references and assignments—including the `widget` Timeline effect for AISVG internal timelines—and read it back.

### Version 2 semantic layout

Version 2 compiles semantic declarations into the same flat keyed reconciler before widget-schema validation. It does not create a second ownership or mutation path.

```json
{
  "version": 2,
  "canvas": { "width": 1920, "height": 1080 },
  "styles": [{
    "key": "roster.text",
    "primitive": "metric-text",
    "layout": { "anchor": { "x": 0, "y": 0 } },
    "properties": { "color": { "r": 245, "g": 245, "b": 245, "a": 1 } }
  }],
  "regions": [{
    "key": "roster",
    "unit": "percent",
    "left": 69,
    "top": 14,
    "width": 31,
    "height": 86
  }],
  "elements": [{
    "key": "title",
    "primitive": "metric-text",
    "style": "roster.text",
    "placement": {
      "region": "roster",
      "left": 8,
      "top": 4,
      "width": 84,
      "height": 8
    },
    "properties": { "text": "STARTING OFFENSE" }
  }]
}
```

`placement` uses top-left coordinates and emits Composer geometry with `anchor: {"x":0,"y":0}`. Its `unit` accepts exactly `"percent"` or `"px"`; do not write `"pixel"`. Omitting `unit` defaults to `"percent"`, but authoring agents should always write it explicitly so pixel values from a screenshot cannot be interpreted as percentages. Percent placement is relative to its named region or the full canvas. Pixel placement and pixel regions require a positive integer design `canvas`; pixels normalize to full-canvas percentages and therefore scale with the active composition. A pixel placement may be inside a pixel region, but not a percent region. Do not combine placement with `cell`, raw `layout.left/top/width/height`, or a non-zero raw anchor. Other supported layout fields remain available.

For a reference measured in design-canvas pixels, declare both the canvas and `unit: "px"`:

```json
{
  "version": 2,
  "canvas": { "width": 1280, "height": 720 },
  "elements": [{
    "key": "scoreboard-shell",
    "primitive": "rectangle",
    "placement": {
      "unit": "px",
      "left": 31,
      "top": 27,
      "width": 355,
      "height": 99
    }
  }]
}
```

A style may contain only `key`, optional `primitive`, `layout`, and `properties`. One `style` reference is allowed per element. The style primitive, when present, must match. Layout and properties merge shallowly by field with explicit element fields winning. Nested non-color runtime objects such as `font` are atomic and must be supplied in their complete widget-runtime shape. For schema fields typed `color` or `gradient`, an RGBA object is the complete preferred solid-color value; supply a structured gradient only when the user explicitly requests one.

Validation and successful apply responses add:

```json
{
  "expansion": {
    "version": 2,
    "authoredEntries": 4,
    "explicitElements": 2,
    "repeatBlocks": 2,
    "expandedElements": 38,
    "stylesUsed": 3,
    "regionsUsed": 2
  }
}
```

Validation errors retain authored paths, including style, region, template, repeat item, and binding locations.

### Declarative control nodes

```json
{
  "key": "visalia-runs",
  "primitive": "metric-text",
  "properties": { "text": "1" },
  "control": {
    "name": "Visalia R",
    "type": "text",
    "property": "text"
  }
}
```

The first apply creates and verifies the control and its link. Reapplying the stable key preserves the same tile and link. A different existing link, type, or control identity is a validation error.

Declarative widget-data controls support `text`, `textarea`, `number`, `normalizednumber`, `counter`, `color`, `image`, `checkbox`, `audio`, `video`, `data`, `jsonfile`, `json`, `datetime`, `location`, `selection`, and `timecontrol` when the primitive's widget field has the compatible type. Tile/group Transform and Effect controls are native node references rather than widget-data links; keyed managed graphics may declare them at the specification root, while ordinary Composer-ID targets use `create-control` or `create-controls` as described in [compositions.md](compositions.md). Their availability is not an authoring default: create them only when the user explicitly asks to expose the exact Transform/Effect property as a Control Node.

When the user explicitly requests public Transform/Effect inputs, declare them at the specification root and target stable declarative keys rather than transient tile IDs:

```json
{
  "version": 2,
  "elements": [{
    "key": "rectangle",
    "primitive": "rectangle",
    "layout": { "width": 30, "height": 20 }
  }],
  "controls": [
    {
      "key": "rectangle-width",
      "name": "rectangle_size_x",
      "type": "number",
      "target": { "elementKey": "rectangle", "property": "width" }
    },
    {
      "key": "rectangle-height",
      "name": "rectangle_size_y",
      "type": "number",
      "target": { "elementKey": "rectangle", "property": "height" }
    }
  ]
}
```

Use `{ "group": "managed", "property": "..." }` instead of `elementKey` to target the specification's `AI Generated` group. Root `controls` support only the documented Transform/Effect layout properties: `checkbox` for `visible`, and `number` for the supported numeric properties. Control keys, names, and targets must be unique. Apply creates missing controls, preserves an exact existing control/node-reference match, and rejects conflicting names or links without mutation. Omitting a previously declared control preserves it because declarative unlink is not supported; delete it only through the explicit inspected Control Node workflow.

The apply response reports widget-data controls on their element and root layout controls under the top-level `controls` object keyed by declarative control key. Each reports the real `id`, `keyId`, `type`, target, link value, and `status` `created` on first apply or `preserved` on an idempotent reapply. Confirm with `control-nodes` afterward: the field and its link must match the reported identities.

### Grids

Define named percentage-based grids at the specification root and place elements by cell:

```json
{
  "grids": [{
    "key": "scoreboard",
    "left": 10,
    "top": 20,
    "width": 80,
    "height": 40,
    "rows": 4,
    "columns": 3,
    "rowGap": 1,
    "columnGap": 1
  }],
  "elements": [{
    "key": "inning-1-visalia",
    "primitive": "metric-text",
    "cell": { "grid": "scoreboard", "row": 1, "column": 1 },
    "properties": { "text": "1" }
  }]
}
```

Cells default to stretched exact bounds. Use `rowSpan`, `columnSpan`, `alignX`, `alignY`, `width`, and `height` for spanning or aligned content. Alignments are `stretch`, `start`, `center`, and `end`; `width` and `height` are percentages of the selected cell bounds.

A cell owns `layout.left`, `top`, `width`, and `height`. Do not mix manual geometry with cell placement.

In version 2, either axis may use positive weighted tracks instead of an equal count:

```json
{
  "key": "roster.columns",
  "left": 71,
  "top": 36,
  "width": 27,
  "height": 60,
  "rowTracks": [1, 1, 1, 1, 1],
  "columnTracks": [3, 18, 3],
  "rowGap": 0.4,
  "columnGap": 0.5
}
```

Do not combine `rows` with `rowTracks` or `columns` with `columnTracks`. Each axis accepts 1-100 positive weights. Gaps are absolute canvas percentages; the remaining space is distributed by weight, and spans include internal gaps.

### Templates and repeats

Version 2 templates are non-recursive arrays of primitive definitions. Each template element has a local `key`, a percent `box` inside one repeated item cell, and optional direct bindings:

```json
{
  "templates": [{
    "key": "roster-row",
    "elements": [{
      "key": "name",
      "primitive": "metric-text",
      "style": "roster.text",
      "box": { "left": 12, "top": 0, "width": 72, "height": 100 },
      "bind": { "properties.text": "name" }
    }]
  }],
  "elements": [{
    "repeat": {
      "key": "starter",
      "template": "roster-row",
      "placement": { "region": "roster", "left": 5, "top": 26, "width": 90, "height": 70 },
      "flow": { "direction": "column", "gap": 0.5 },
      "items": [{ "key": "1", "values": { "name": "PLAYER NAME" } }]
    }
  }]
}
```

Only column flow is supported. The repeat placement is divided into equal-height item cells after subtracting absolute percentage gaps. A template `box` is top-left percent geometry inside its item cell. Expansion replaces the repeat block in place, ordered by item and then template element, and generates stable keys as `<repeat>.<item>.<template-element>`.

Bindings are direct item-value lookups only. Destinations are `name`, `properties.<widget-field-id>`, and `control.name`; sources are one safe item-value key. There is no interpolation, traversal, expression, arithmetic, or function language. Resolved values still pass the existing widget and Control Node type checks.

Limits are enforced before mutation: 100 expanded primitives; 100 root layout controls; 25 styles, regions, templates, and repeat blocks; 25 elements per template; 100 repeat items total; and 100 tracks per grid axis. Reapplying the same item keys preserves generated tile identities; reordering items changes layer order without changing those identities.

## Design guidance

Apply the construction rules, visual-quality requirements, and completion gate in [authoring-quality.md](authoring-quality.md). That document owns the authoring principles; the guidance below is limited to translating them into Composer graphics and declarative layout.

From a reference screenshot:

- Work in percentages of the active Composer resolution.
- Treat tables and grids semantically instead of calculating every position by hand.
- Use one text element per independently aligned or controlled value, aligned to exact cell bounds.
- Identify dynamic fields before building and give them stable keys and declarative controls.
- Identify large background shapes first, then accents, images, and text.

For Composer Text sizing, remember that an automatic overflow mode such as `adjustLetterSize` makes layout height strongly affect the resulting font size. Size the text box to the intended text line rather than stretching it over the full height of its background panel.
